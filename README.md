# Monoalphabetic-cipher
The role of this program is to decrypt jpg image file corrupted by monoalphabetic method.
the meaning is that every value of byte was changed by a same constant number.
when the program will stop running, search in the folder that you have just created. 
you should be able to see clearly the decrypted photo.
Notice that 255 files will be created automatically during this process.
